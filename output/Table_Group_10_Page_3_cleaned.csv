Here's how to unpivot the provided CSV data into the requested two-column format, along with the resulting output:

**Understanding the Process**

The goal is to transform the wide format (where years are columns) into a long format (where each row represents a single data point). We'll achieve this by iterating through each year (column header) and for each data row, creating a new row that combines the row's description with the corresponding year and value.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify Headers:** The first row contains numerical headers (0, 1, 2, 3). These are less informative.
2.  **Identify Row Descriptions:** The first column contains the descriptions for each data point (Financial Year, Total no. of Sponsored Projects, etc.).
3.  **Identify Column Headers (Years):** The second row ("Financial Year") contains the actual headers we want to use as part of our 'Description' column.
4.  **Extract Data:** Iterate through the remaining rows, pairing the description from the first column with the values in each year's column.
5.  **Construct 'Description':** For each data point, combine the description from the first column and the year from the second row to form a descriptive label.
6.  **Construct 'Value':** This is the actual data point from the intersected row and year column.
7.  **Filter Empty/Null:** Exclude any rows where the 'Value' is empty or null.

**CSV Input:**

```csv
0,1,2,3
Financial Year,2023-24,2022-23,2021-22
Total no. of Sponsored Projects,1583,1378,1334
Total no. of Funding Agencies,530,445,368
Total Amount Received (Amount in Rupees),5979393642,4762663592,4352399044
Amount Received in Words,"Five Hundred Ninety Seven Crore Ninety Three Lakh Ninety
Three Thousand  Six Hundred and Forty Two Only","Four Hundred Seventy Six Crores Twenty Six Lakhs Sixty
Three Thousand Five Hundred and Ninety Two Only","Four Hundred Thirty Five Crore Twenty Three Lakhs Ninety
Nine Thousand and Forty Four Only"
```

**Unpivoted Output (as CSV):**

```csv
Description,Value
Financial Year - 2023-24,2023-24
Financial Year - 2022-23,2022-23
Financial Year - 2021-22,2021-22
Total no. of Sponsored Projects - 2023-24,1583
Total no. of Sponsored Projects - 2022-23,1378
Total no. of Sponsored Projects - 2021-22,1334
Total no. of Funding Agencies - 2023-24,530
Total no. of Funding Agencies - 2022-23,445
Total no. of Funding Agencies - 2021-22,368
Total Amount Received (Amount in Rupees) - 2023-24,5979393642
Total Amount Received (Amount in Rupees) - 2022-23,4762663592
Total Amount Received (Amount in Rupees) - 2021-22,4352399044
Amount Received in Words - 2023-24,"Five Hundred Ninety Seven Crore Ninety Three Lakh Ninety Three Thousand  Six Hundred and Forty Two Only"
Amount Received in Words - 2022-23,"Four Hundred Seventy Six Crores Twenty Six Lakhs Sixty Three Thousand Five Hundred and Ninety Two Only"
Amount Received in Words - 2021-22,"Four Hundred Thirty Five Crore Twenty Three Lakhs Ninety Nine Thousand and Forty Four Only"
```

**Explanation of the Output:**

*   **`Description` Column:** Each entry in this column is a combination of the row's original description (from the first column) and the corresponding year from the second row. For example, "Total no. of Sponsored Projects - 2023-24".
*   **`Value` Column:** This column contains the actual data point that was found at the intersection of the row and the year column. For example, "1583" for "Total no. of Sponsored Projects - 2023-24".
*   **Empty/Null Exclusion:** No empty or null values were present in the data to begin with, so no rows were excluded based on this criterion.

This output successfully transforms the data into the desired two-column, descriptive format.
